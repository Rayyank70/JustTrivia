## Usage

Please use a small number of questions for the time being. The API that I used to retrieve the trivia questions does not have enough questions to fulfill all requests. For a full list of all available questions per category, please visit https://opentdb.com/api_count_global.php

A good sample usage would be "Number of Players: 1, Number of rounds: 10, Category: General Knowledge, Difficulty: Medium"

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Complete UIKit StoryBoard for each View Controller
- [x] Setup UITextField and UIPickerView Protocol methods needed for SelectionViewController
- [x] Create backend models for retreiving API data and decoding
- [x] Connect front and back ends
- [ ] TODO: Account for situations where OpenTriviaDB returns error codes based on lack of questions, currently app just crashes
- [ ] Include more aspects of hand around multiplayer
